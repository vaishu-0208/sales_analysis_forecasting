# Sales Forecasting Using Prophet (Time Series Project)

This project focuses on forecasting future sales using the **Prophet model** developed by Facebook. It involves time series analysis on historical sales data, identifying patterns, and predicting the next 90 days of sales.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed sales data
- Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Built a time series model using Prophet
- Forecasted future sales
- Compared predictions with actual values
- Evaluated model using MAE (₹1,586.46)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Prophet (for forecasting)

## Results
The model was able to predict future sales trends with good accuracy. Actual vs predicted sales were plotted for visual comparison.

## Files
- `sales_forecasting.ipynb` – The full notebook
- `train.csv` – Dataset used (if sharable)
- `README.md` – Project summary

## Future Ideas
- Add holiday effects in Prophet
- Try ARIMA or LSTM for comparison
